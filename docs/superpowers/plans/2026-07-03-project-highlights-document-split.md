# Project Highlights Document Split Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create one index and five independent, code-focused Markdown guides for the project's five highlights, following the structure of the supplied like-system reference guide.

**Architecture:** Keep the existing overview document and add a focused `docs/project-highlights/` documentation set. Each guide owns one technical boundary, uses real source snippets and paths, and follows the same architecture → code index → Step flow → mechanism → code explanation → summary → interview sequence.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, Java/Spring Boot, StateGraph, Kafka, Python/ONNX, Vue/Pinia, Nginx, Docker Compose

---

## File Structure

- Create `docs/project-highlights/README.md`: navigation, summaries, reading order, and interview usage.
- Create `docs/project-highlights/01-hermes-multi-agent-memory.md`: StateGraph, routing, memory, confirmation, checkpoint, and guard details.
- Create `docs/project-highlights/02-intelligent-business-assistant.md`: UI-to-Agent business interaction, SSE, cards, sessions, voice, and ownership isolation.
- Create `docs/project-highlights/03-kafka-image-detection.md`: OSS upload, Kafka events, Python Worker, ONNX inference, offset handling, and idempotency.
- Create `docs/project-highlights/04-model-quality-traceability.md`: model validation/lifecycle and the review-disposition-rework traceability workflow.
- Create `docs/project-highlights/05-nginx-docker-deployment.md`: frontend/backend images, Compose topology, Nginx proxy/load balancing, SSE, and security.
- Modify `docs/project-highlights-interview-guide.md`: add links to the five deep-dive guides while retaining its overview role.

Expected: no placeholders; every relative Markdown file target resolves from its containing document.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify required structure in all five guides**

Run a PowerShell loop checking for `整体架构`, `代码位置索引`, `详细流程`, `代码详解`, `关键设计总结`, and `面试` in every numbered guide.

Expected: every guide contains every required section.

```powershell
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Expected: no whitespace errors; only intended documentation files remain changed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit the overview links and final verification adjustments**

```powershell
git add docs/project-highlights-interview-guide.md docs/project-highlights
git commit -m "docs: complete project highlight deep dives"
```
